<p class= "txt">The classic quick-draw game since 1985<br><br>
	Number of Players 2-4 Players<br><br>
You don’t have to be an artist; in fact, if you “can’t draw,” the game can be even funnier<br><br>
Two levels of clues (120 Adult, 80 Junior) make this a great game for kids and adults<br><br>
Includes two erasable makers, erasable boards for drawing and an updated category of clues<br><br>
Get together with friends to find out who's an artist and who really isn't!</p>
